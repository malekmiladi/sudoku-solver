# Sudoku Solver

Sudoku game with a backtracking solver implementation.

## How to use

Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the program:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

Use your mouse to select a cell, and use the numpad or number row to input a digit. For now, the game doesn't tell you whether or not you solved the puzzle, as it is mainly made to visualize the backtracking algorithm. 

To run the auto solver, hit <kbd>â†µ Enter</kbd> and wait for the algorithm to finish.
